This folder is a collection of files and scripts that pertain to the development, testing, and visualization of machine learning models. 
The primary purpose of the folder is to create and test machine learning models on various inputs, which can include numerical or categorical. 
The folder contains different types of machine learning models such as regression models and classification models. Additionally, 
the folder may contain a visualization subfolder that contains scripts for generating different 
types of visualizations such as bar charts, logistic regression plots, confusion matrices, and others. These visualizations can be 
useful for interpreting the results of the machine learning models and for communicating those results to others. Overall, the folder 
is a valuable resource for individuals and organizations that are interested in developing and testing machine learning models on different inputs.

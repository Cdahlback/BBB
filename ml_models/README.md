# Machine Learning Models Development and Testing

This folder contains a collection of files and scripts for developing, testing, and visualizing machine learning models. The primary purpose of this folder is to facilitate the creation of machine learning models on various inputs, including both numerical and categorical data.

## Models

This folder contains various types of machine learning models, including:

- Regression models
- Classification models
## Visualization

The visualization subfolder contains scripts for generating different types of visualizations, such as:

- Bar charts
- Logistic regression plots
- Confusion matrices
- And more

These visualizations are useful for interpreting the results of machine learning models and for communicating those results to others.

Overall, this folder is a valuable resource for individuals and organizations interested in developing and testing machine learning models on different inputs.

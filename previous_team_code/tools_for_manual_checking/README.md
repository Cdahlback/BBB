## manual_url_checking_helper.py
Running this script opens up a website in the selected broswer and gives you details about what the database says the website should be. After you enter in a 1 or a 0, it moves onto the next website.

## manually_check_scrapers.py
Running this script selects a random sample from the database, and checks if the website of each buissness works, and if it does it prints out all of the results from the independent variables.

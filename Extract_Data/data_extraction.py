For CODE REVIEWER:
This file is used to hold all our functions which extract data from a url
There are two types of functions you see here, listed below
- functions which start with "contains"
    - These functions scrape html/soup for independent variables we plan to use in our ML model 
      (don't know what model will work best quite yet)
    - Return a 0 or 1 which tells us if the ind var was found within our html/soup
- functions which start with extract
    - Scrape html/soup for data types we are looking to fill in our csv file (emails, phone#s, addresses)
    - Return the data type(s) we found from that single html/soup

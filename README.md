# Project: Better Business Bureau (BBB) Data Validation and Enhancement
The Better Business Bureau (BBB) is an organization that helps consumers find trustworthy businesses and promotes marketplace trust between businesses and consumers. The BBB sets standards for marketplace trust, supports best practices in business, and addresses substandard behavior in businesses. The BBB has regional offices across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, each with local autonomy to meet the specific needs of their region's consumers and businesses.

The BBB collects and manages a large amount of data about businesses, including their URLs, website links, primary contact information, and addresses. It is crucial that this data is accurate and up-to-date for the BBB to maintain trust in the marketplace. However, large collections of data can rapidly become out-of-date and inaccurate.

This project is the second collaboration between the BBB's Twin Cities chapter and the International Association of Better Business Bureaus (IABBB) to enhance the accuracy of the BBB's database. The goal of this project is to develop web data scraping techniques and related modules for data validation, verification, and database content confirmation. The focus will be on working with URLs and email addresses and their intersection to add new "good" data to the database.

Last semester, the CS student team successfully automated the removal of "bad" data from the BBB's database. This semester, the team will use data engineering techniques to acquire and clean new data and data science techniques to ensure the resulting data's quality. The team will also develop computing components that support deduplication of existing database entries and data cleansing of new inbound data.

The main client for this project is Ryan Sharp of the BBB Twin Cities, and the team will work closely with technical and organizational specialists Eli Johnson and Rubens Pessahna of the IABBB, as well as other colleagues they may choose to include.
